# Goals

A significant, and perhaps increasing, part of our work as research software engineers is to design and implement infrastructure solutions for research and scientific applications. This includes applications that run in the cloud.

The goals for this repo is to provide examples of solutions that RSEs have used in their work and share them. This may be in form of
- architectural diagrams
- sharing practical experiences (such as what lessons did we learn)
- sharing code in form of Ansible or Terraform scripts


## First Steps

In the first instance, we try to find use cases where RSEs built infrastructure for research applications. Is there such a thing as a "typical use case" (or set of use cases?). 


## Examples

TBD

## Awareness and Collaboration

I suspect there are a lot of different use cases for cloud, or more generally apps, and if we can better understand how others in the RSEng space are doing things, it introduces more rich opportunity for collaboration and working together on projects!
